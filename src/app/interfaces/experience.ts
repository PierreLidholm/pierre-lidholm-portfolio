  <p>At SEB, I worked as a full-stack developer focusing on both frontend and backend within a microservices architecture. On the backend, I developed and maintained services using C# and .NET.</p>

<p>I also worked on a backend-for-frontend (BFF) solution to support new frontend implementations.</p>

<p>All code was managed in GitHub with version control and CI/CD pipelines, including automated system and integration tests for each deployment.</p>

<p>On the frontend, I developed and maintained microfrontend components and product pages on SEBâ€™s website using Angular, with a strong focus on accessibility in compliance with WCAG standards. Testing was carried out using tools such as Jest, Lighthouse, Axe, and Playwright.</p>

<p>We followed agile methodologies using Scrum, with sprint planning and daily stand-ups in close collaboration with developers, designers, and product owners.</p>

     <p>I worked as a full-stack developer responsible for developing and maintaining web-based applications and APIs in .NET using C#. I built new solutions as well as enhanced existing systems.</p>

<p>Frontend development was done using Angular and AngularJS, where I worked with both TypeScript and JavaScript to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces. I was also responsible for the database layer, designing and building MSSQL databases.</p>

<p>My role covered the full development cycle, from requirements analysis and planning to implementation, testing, and deployment. I collaborated with clients to understand user needs and translate them into technical solutions, continuously implementing new features and improving existing systems.</p>

<p>Version control and deployments were handled using Azure DevOps.</p>
