    <p>
      I'm a developer based in Sweden, specializing in building modern,
      accessible, and responsive web applications. My core stack includes
      Angular, TypeScript, and .NET â€” tools I use to create clean, maintainable
      code and engaging user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working across the stack, whether it's building intuitive frontend
      interfaces or developing reliable backend functionality. I'm always eager
      to learn, improve, and contribute to meaningful projects.
    </p>

    <p>I'm currently open to both freelance and full-time opportunities.</p>
